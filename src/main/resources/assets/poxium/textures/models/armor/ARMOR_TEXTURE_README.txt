ARMOR TEXTURE LAYERS
====================

Place the armor layer textures here (64x32 PNG files):

- poxium_layer_1.png - Used for helmet, chestplate, and boots
- poxium_layer_2.png - Used for leggings

These textures define how the armor looks when worn on a player.

You can use vanilla Minecraft armor textures as templates:
- Diamond armor: assets/minecraft/textures/models/armor/diamond_layer_1.png
- Diamond armor: assets/minecraft/textures/models/armor/diamond_layer_2.png

Modify these templates to have a corrupted, fungal appearance fitting the
Poxium theme (browns, purples, dark greens with spore-like particles).

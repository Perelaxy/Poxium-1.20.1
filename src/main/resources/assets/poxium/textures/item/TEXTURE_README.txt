TEXTURE PLACEHOLDER
===================

Please add 16x16 PNG texture files for Poxium items at these locations:

WEAPON:
- src/main/resources/assets/poxium/textures/item/poxium_sword.png

ARMOR ITEMS (inventory icons):
- src/main/resources/assets/poxium/textures/item/poxium_helmet.png
- src/main/resources/assets/poxium/textures/item/poxium_chestplate.png
- src/main/resources/assets/poxium/textures/item/poxium_leggings.png
- src/main/resources/assets/poxium/textures/item/poxium_boots.png

ARMOR TEXTURES (worn on player):
You'll also need to create armor layer textures (64x32 PNG files):
- src/main/resources/assets/poxium/textures/models/armor/poxium_layer_1.png (helmet, chestplate, boots)
- src/main/resources/assets/poxium/textures/models/armor/poxium_layer_2.png (leggings)

All textures should have a diseased, corrupted, or fungal appearance to fit the 
Poxium Blight theme. Consider using browns, purples, and greens to represent 
the mycelium/spore aesthetic.

You can use any image editing software to create these textures, or find them from
a resource pack creator. For armor layers, you can use vanilla armor textures as 
a template and modify them.
